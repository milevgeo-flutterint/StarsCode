          Please generate a Pull Request Description for these staged changes following this template.

          Here are some instructions to follow:
          - For Projects involved, I want to add which projects are affected, for example if parent
          folder is poker-power-path-widget it should be PP, if the changed file is used the widget,
          - For the Locales, if there are translations involved, only then should check all locales, if no translations added, english is enough.

          Here is the template:
